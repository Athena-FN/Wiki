# Starting your backend

## Initialising your project:
1. Open a terminal window, depending on your OS (such as Windows, which has CMD), and go to a new folder. It can be anywhere.
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, and run the command ``` npm i ```, which will initialise your project. Add in the details you want, like the name. Everything but the name is optional.
3. Open up a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and open your project folder.
4. Create a new file called ``` index.js ``` and add the following code:
  ```
  const express = require("express");
const app = express();



const PORT = 3551;



app.listen(PORT, async() => {
    console.log(`Backend started listening on port ${PORT}.`);
}).on("error", async (err) => {
    if (err.code == "EADDRINUSE") {
        log.error(`Port ${PORT} is already in use!\nClosing in 3 seconds...`);
        await functions.sleep(3000)
        process.exit(0);
    } else throw err;
});
}

  ```
5. You have now began developing your backend!
