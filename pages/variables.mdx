# Adding environment variables

1. Reopen your terminal window back to your project folder.
2. Run the command ``` npm install dotenv ```, which will install the dotenv package.
3. Go to your index.js file and change it to the following
  ```
  const express = require("express");
const app = express();
require("dotenv").config();



const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3551;



app.listen(PORT, async() => {
    console.log(`Backend started listening on port ${PORT}.`);
}).on("error", async (err) => {
    if (err.code == "EADDRINUSE") {
        log.error(`Port ${PORT} is already in use!\nClosing in 3 seconds...`);
        await functions.sleep(3000)
        process.exit(0);
    } else throw err;
});
}

  ```
5. Create a file called .env in your project directory and add the following line of text, you can change the port to whatever you want: ``` PORT=3551 ```
